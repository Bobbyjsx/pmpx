  #### Summary of Changes

  This changeset introduces significant updates to the `pmpx` project, including a migration to TypeScript, a new folder structure, and the addition of several development tools and dependencies. The changes aim to improve maintainability, developer experience, and code quality.

  ***

  ### Major Changes

  #### 1. **Migration to TypeScript**

  - The project has been migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.
  - New TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) has been added.
  - All source files have been moved to the `src` directory and converted to `.ts` files.
  - The `dist` directory now contains the compiled JavaScript files.

  #### 2. **New Folder Structure**

  - The project has been reorganized into a more modular and maintainable structure:
    ```
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/                # Entry point for the CLI
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/               # Compiled output files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/               # Documentation files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                # Source files (TypeScript)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/       # CLI commands
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Utility functions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ biome.json          # Biome configuration
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
    ```
  - The `utils` folder has been moved under `src` and now contains TypeScript files.

  #### 3. **CLI Entry Point Update**

  - The CLI entry point (`bin/index.js`) now directly references the compiled `dist/index.js` file instead of containing the logic itself.

  #### 4. **Removed Legacy Files**

  - The following legacy files have been removed:
    - `utils/config.js`
    - `utils/configHandler.js`
    - `utils/detectPM.js`
    - `utils/pmpxConfigHandler.js`
  - These files have been replaced with their TypeScript counterparts in the `src` directory.

  ***

  ### Minor Changes

  #### 1. **New Development Tools**

  - Added the following dev dependencies:
    - `typescript`: For TypeScript compilation.
    - `ts-node`: For running TypeScript files directly.
    - `@types/node`: Type definitions for Node.js.
    - `@types/chalk-animation`: Type definitions for `chalk-animation`.
    - `@biomejs/biome`: For linting and formatting.
    - `husky`: For managing Git hooks.
  - Added `biome.json` for Biome configuration.

  #### 2. **Updated Scripts in `package.json`**

  - Added new scripts:
    - `build`: Compiles TypeScript files to JavaScript.
    - `start`: Runs the project using `ts-node`.
    - `lint`: Runs Biome to check code quality.
    - `format`: Formats code using Biome.
    - `prepare`: Sets up Husky Git hooks.
  - Updated the `prepublishOnly` script to ensure the project is built before publishing.

  #### 3. **Husky Integration**

  - Added Husky for managing Git hooks.
  - The `prepare` script ensures Husky is set up when dependencies are installed.

  #### 4. **Biome Integration**

  - Added Biome for linting and formatting.
  - Configured Biome to check and format the entire project.

  #### 5. **Changesets Integration**

  - Updated the `changeset` configuration to align with the new project structure.
  - Added scripts for generating and publishing changesets.

  #### 6. **Dependency Updates**

  - Updated `@types/node` to version `22.15.3`.
  - Added several optional dependencies for improved compatibility and performance.

  ***

  ### Patch Changes

  #### 1. **Improved CLI Commands**

  - Refactored CLI commands into separate modules under `src/commands`:
    - `anim.ts`: Handles animations.
    - `config.ts`: Manages configuration.
    - `help.ts`: Displays help messages.
    - `proxy.ts`: Proxies commands to the detected package manager.

  #### 2. **Improved Package Manager Detection**

  - The `detectPM` utility has been rewritten in TypeScript for better maintainability.

  #### 3. **Documentation Updates**

  - Added a `docs` folder containing:
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
    - `RELEASING.md`: Steps for releasing a new version.

  #### 4. **Improved Build Process**

  - The build process now compiles TypeScript files into the `dist` directory.
  - The `bin/index.js` file references the compiled `dist/index.js` file.

  ***

  ### Breaking Changes

  #### 1. **Removed Legacy Config Handling**

  - The legacy `config.js` and `configHandler.js` files have been removed.
  - Configuration management is now handled by the new `src/utils/config.ts` module.

  #### 2. **Removed Legacy Package Manager Detection**

  - The legacy `detectPM.js` file has been removed.
  - Package manager detection is now handled by the new `src/utils/detectPM.ts` module.

  #### 3. **CLI Behavior Changes**

  - The CLI now relies on the compiled `dist` files, which requires running `npm run build` before using the CLI locally.

  ***

  ### Migration Guide

  1. **Install New Dependencies**

     - Run `npm install` to install the new dependencies.

  2. **Build the Project**

     - Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript files.

  3. **Update CLI Usage**

     - Ensure the CLI entry point (`bin/index.js`) references the compiled `dist/index.js` file.

  4. **Adopt New Folder Structure**

     - Move any custom files or scripts to the appropriate directories in the new folder structure.

  5. **Use New Scripts**
     - Use the updated `lint`, `format`, and `build` scripts for development.

  ***

  ### Notes

  - These changes improve the overall developer experience and align the project with modern best practices.
  - The migration to TypeScript ensures better type safety and maintainability.
  - The new folder structure makes the project more modular and easier to navigate.
